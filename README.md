(FK) RecipeID  
(FK) IngredientID  

Notes on the Link Table:  
This table lists the Main Ingredients of a recipe, not including substitutions. If an ingredient is optional, it is **not included** in the link table. 

### Ingredient Table
(PK) IngredientID  
Name  

IngredientID: Generated surrogate key for the entity.  
Name: The name of the ingredient

Notes on Ingredient's subtypes:  
A food is determined "vegan" and features a suffix "VE" at the end of the ingredientID. Such as, ID 50 would be 50VE as a composite key.  
Non vegan foods are as is, with just the surrogate primary key. In essential, the **Vegan subtype features an attribute of "ID Suffix" with the value 'VE' to form an identifiable composite key.**

### Ingredient Substitution Self-Referential Link Table
(FK) IngredientID  
(FK) IngredientID  

Notes on combinations:  
Substitutions are two-way, meaning Butter - Margarine is the same as Margarine - Butter. These values could be rearranged to include both versions in the act of denormalization to improve speed (e.g., only search 1 column for the ingredient ID).
